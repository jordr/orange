### FrontC dependency

The **FrontC** library is required to build oRange.
Just unpack and compile its sources at the same level as the oRange directory.
FrontC may be obtained and built from source from https://git.renater.fr/anonscm/git/orange/Frontc.git
It is also available as a package from https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/FrontC/

```sh
$ git clone https://git.renater.fr/anonscm/git/orange/Frontc.git ../frontc
$ (cd ../frontc; make) # Make FrontC
$ make # Make oRange
```

oRange executable may be found in `main/orange`.
