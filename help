To use Orange

Restriction no recurrent functions
no other restrictions using calipso



first you have to use calipso with -P   -rs -rr -rg   -rc -rb -l    options to preprocess c source and to have more easier equivalent c source in term of execution path (no goto only one return no switch, no break) l option keep previous line number.

then you can apply orange on c source resulting on calipso
as an example  ./../orange/main/main  -pp -l  debieC/debie6.c HealthMonitoringTask Start_Conversion End_Of_ADC SetSensorUnitOff> debieC/debie6.pret
 -pp -l to know the initial line number of loop and function call

next the first argument is the c source file to evaluate 
the nest one is the name of the function head of the flow fact
the other one are the names of the function to evaluate call number.

#example of script 
./../Frontc-3.2-3/frontc/calipso/calipso   -P   -rs -rr -rg   -rc -rb   -l  originaux/clement13.c>pretraites/clement13.c
time  ./../orange/main/main -pp -l  pretraites/clement13.c main main > analyses/clement13.ana
